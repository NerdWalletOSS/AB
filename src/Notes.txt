Keep in mind that the following 2 constants are defined in 2 places. Hence, a change in one must be reflected as a change in the other. 
AB_MAX_NUM_TESTS in src/ab_constants.h and 
max_num_tests in php/db.conf.json

AB_MAX_NUM_ACTIVE_TESTS in src/ab_constants.h and 
max_num_active_tests in php/db.conf.json
