Wyatt suggested we use:
nw.metrics.ab.requests
nw.metrics.ab.request_time

Hey Ramesh,

This library https://github.com/romanbsd/statsd-c-client should I
think work for metrics collection as well (we will have to install a
monitoring agent on the box but we should do that anyways).

I'm CCing Wyatt as I forgot which namespaces we are using already, but
if you do something like:

const float sample_rate = 1.0; // I don't think sending metrics every request will harm performance but if it does we could lower this

link = statsd_init("localhost", 8125);
statsd_inc(link, "com.nerdwallet.ab.requests (Wyatt to help with actual name)", sample_rate);
statsd_timing(link, "com.nerdwallet.ab.request_time", req_time);

I think it should capture the two major pieces of info we're
interested in. DataDog will take care of capturing medians, p95, p99
etc numbers for us.
