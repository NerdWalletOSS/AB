If you know the user agent that is not behaving as expected

1) Check in DWH table if user agent exists at all
2) If it does, does it have the right mapping
3) In AB/src/MK_UA_TO_DEV/MAP/, Add user agent to sample_user_agent.csv and run ut.sh and see if device_id is consistent with DWH
4) Deploy new bin file to AB server. 

Use something like https://www.urlencoder.org/ to encode the user agent. For example, 
Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.4; en-us; Kindle Fire Build/GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1
becomes
Mozilla%2F5.0%20%28Linux%3B%20U%3B%20Android%202.3.4%3B%20en-us%3B%20Kindle%20Fire%20Build%2FGINGERBREAD%29%20AppleWebKit%2F533.1%20%28KHTML%2C%20like%20Gecko%29%20Version%2F4.0%20Mobile%20Safari%2F533.1


 curl --url "localhost:8000/UAToDevice?UserAgent=Mozilla%2F5.0%20%28Linux%3B%20U%3B%20Android%202.3.4%3B%20en-us%3B%20Kindle%20Fire%20Build%2FGINGERBREAD%29%20AppleWebKit%2F533.1%20%28KHTML%2C%20like%20Gecko%29%20Version%2F4.0%20Mobile%20Safari%2F533.1"


This should return something like { "Device": "Tablet_Android", "DeviceID" : "5" }

Last check: Click on the actual URL Example : https://www.nerdwallet.com/ur/?nw_campaign_id=151327949360796300

In the URL, it should end with DeviceID=N, where N should be between 1 and 6. Anything else is a problem.
