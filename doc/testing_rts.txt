1) There are times when you do not want to have WebApp talk to RTS. This is useful for standalone testing. In such cases, your /opt/abadmin/db2.json file looks like this

  "ab_rts_server" : "",
  "ab_rts_port"   : "8000",
  "webapp_server" : "localhost",
  "webapp_port"   : "8080",
  "rts_finder_server" : "",
  "rts_finder_port"   : "8020”,


2) If you want to use the RTS on localhost but do NOT want to use the RTS finder, then it looks like 

  "ab_rts_server" : "localhost",
  "ab_rts_port"   : "8000",
  "webapp_server" : "localhost",
  "webapp_port"   : "8080",
  "rts_finder_server" : "",
  "rts_finder_port"   : "8020”,

3) If you wan to use RTS on localhost but you want to ALSO use the RTS finder, then it looks like 

  "ab_rts_server" : "",
  "ab_rts_port"   : "8000",
  "webapp_server" : "localhost",
  "webapp_port"   : "8080",
  "rts_finder_server" : “localhost",
  "rts_finder_port"   : "8020”,

Remember, that to use RTS finder,
cd AB/rts_finder/
python rts_server.py -T localhost:8000  &
