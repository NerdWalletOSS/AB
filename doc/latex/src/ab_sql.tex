\section{Introduction}

The AB Admin Webapp stores information needed by the AB system in a relational database.
The naming convention used is in \verb+place_doc_here+.

There are four kinds of tables 
\be
\item configuration tables. These do not directly contain information about AB test.
Instead, they contain auxiliary information e.g., list of authorized users,
kinds of tests supported, names od devices recognized, \ldots
\item test info tables. These contain the details of tests created by users
\item debugging tables. These are used to create audit reports and to
  analyze usage of the system.
\item log tables. These contain changes made to the test info tables as
described in Section~\ref{journaling_tables}

\section{Journaling Tables}
\label{journaling_tables}

All changes to the database are made by the Admin WebApp using transactions.
There are no deletes to the database, only inserts and updates. 
In every transaction, a copy of the rows modified/created are stored in log
tables that are identical to the original table with the following exceptions
\be
\item there is no primary key
\item there are no constraints place on data in these tables
\item every field in the original table exists in the journaling table
\item there are two additional fields
  \be
\item \verb+txn_name+ a string that has the same value for all rows affected by
  a particular transaction
\item \verb+txn_id+ which identifies the operation made by the middle-tier i.e.,
  it identifies the logical purpose for performing the transaction. This is a
  foreign key to the table \verb+txn_type+
