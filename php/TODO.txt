Inform RTS needs to be fixed

When you terminate a device specific test, the winning variant 
is the same for all devices. This needs to be fixed.

If a test is marked as device specific, then you should not be able to 
change percentages in variants table.

Have is_device_specific and channel be set when a test is created
This needs more thought since we need to set percentages for variants in any
case to something legal.



When you unset or change channel, you need to unset pred_id as well
