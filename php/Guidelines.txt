Any time you are dealing with a function that prints to stdout you can
capture that output in an output buffer, like this:

// Start buffer capture.
ob_start(); 
// Output here was captured in the buffer rather than stdout.
debug_print_backtrace(); 
// Contents of the buffer were returned and the buffer was flushed from memory.
return ob_get_clean(); 


Technically all inputs to the current script are available in
php://input, but I never access this directly. The standard
superglobals like $_POST, $_GET, etc.  are PHP's parsed version of
this same data, so it's considered a best practice to always access
input data through these superglobals instead of php://input.  Any
query params in the URL will be available in $_GET, while any data
sent in the body of a POST request will be available in $_POST.
